Below are some checklists for common scenarios.

## Adding a New Built-in SQL Command

1. Implement the function in C and place it in the appropriate directory under `src` (typically in `src/utils/adt`)
2. Each function should have a unique integer OID. Run the script `src/include/catalog/unused_oids` to find available ranges.
3. Add the entry to `pg_proc.dat` following the surrounding conventions.
